#Exploratory Activity 1


1. Which package/library did you select?\
   The package/library selected in Turtle within Python.

2. What is the package/library?\
   The Turtle package "provides a representation of a physics 'turtle' (a little robot with a pen) that draws on a sheet of paper on the floor[1]". The package "was originally created as an educational tool, to be used by teachers in the classroom [1]". Turtle package is an "effective[1]" and "well-proven way for learners to encounder programming concepts and interaction with software" because "it provides instant, visible feedback [1]". In turtle, the "onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle[2]". \
   To use turtle, it is crucial to use "version 3 of Python[2]". It is also significant to be "familiar with your programming environment[2]" and it depends on the user to "use applications like IDLE or Jupyter Notebook to program with turtle[2]" or probably use "REPL[2]". To use turtle, is is important to remember that turtle is a "built-in library, so you don't need to install any new packages[2]". The first step to use turtle would be to "import it into your Python environment[2]".
