# Exploratory Activity 1

## Section 1: Which package/library does the sample program demonstrate?
The library that the sample program demonstrates is Turtle. The programming language used is Python.

## Section 2: How does someone run your program?
To run the program, the user needs to download the program from GitHub and shift the program to a directory of the choice of the user. The user should navigate to the directory through command line and needs to run the program using `python3 sampleprogram.py`. The program would run and the inputs would be visible. The user would be required to enter the slope and y-intercept of the linear graph that the user is willing to draw. 

## Section 3: What purpose does your program serve?
The sample program used the Python programming language and functions provided by Turtle to draw linear graphs based on the slope and y-coordinate or y-intercept inputted by the user. The program plots the x-axis and the y-axis. Then, the program writes useful information like the scale on the graph. Then, based on the slope and y-cintercept inputted by the user, the program calculates the different coordinates that lie on the graph using the formula `y=mx+c` [1] where "m is the gradient of the line [1]" and "c is the y-intercept [1]". The purpose of the program is to draw linear graphs using turtle and python with just 2 inputs: slope and y-intercept.

## What would be some sample input/output?
Sample input 1: 
```
Enter the slope of the linear line graph: 5
Enter the y-intercept of the linear line graph: 54
```
